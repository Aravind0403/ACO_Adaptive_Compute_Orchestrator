─────────────────────
The pheromone matrix: the ACO colony's shared, persistent memory.

What is pheromone?
──────────────────
In nature, ants deposit chemical pheromone on paths they walk.
Shorter paths get reinforced more (ants traverse them faster, deposit more).
Over time the colony converges on the optimal path — without any ant
having a global view of the network.

In this scheduler:
  • "Path"   = assigning a specific job to a specific node.
  • "Better" = lower total placement cost (cheaper node, more headroom).
  • τ[i][j]  = pheromone on the arc "place job i on node j".

Two forces balance each other:
  1. Evaporation  — global forgetting. All pheromone decays each iteration.
                    Prevents the colony from locking onto a suboptimal early
                    solution and never trying anything else.
  2. Deposit      — positive reinforcement. After each iteration, the best
                    solution gets extra pheromone. Better solutions get more.
                    Over iterations, good arcs accumulate high τ values,
                    making them increasingly attractive to all ants.

Matrix layout
─────────────
  Shape : (n_jobs, n_nodes)
  τ[i][j]: pheromone level for placing the i-th job on the j-th node.
  Indices are positional integers maintained by the Colony class.
  The matrix itself knows nothing about job IDs or node IDs —
  that translation is the Colony's responsibility.

NumPy design choices
────────────────────
  • float64 throughout — float32 accumulates measurable rounding drift
    over 5+ iterations of multiply-then-add cycles.
  • In-place operations (*=, +=) — avoid allocating new arrays on the
    hot path. For a 20×10 matrix this saves ~200 float64 allocations
    per iteration.
  • np.clip(..., out=self._matrix) — clips in-place, same reason.
  • .copy() only in snapshot() — the one place we need a safe copy.

  1.0 × 0.9^5 ≈ 0.59 (still above TAU_MIN=0.01 — plenty of signal left).

Higher ρ → faster forgetting → more exploration (risks oscillation).
Lower ρ  → slower forgetting → more exploitation (risks premature convergence).

            The ant's probability calculation creates its own new arrays
            (tau ** ALPHA, eta ** BETA, etc.) so this is safe by design.

        Why a view and not a copy?
            For a 10-node row, copying 10 float64 values is trivial.
            But the habit matters: returning views avoids unnecessary
            allocations on the hot path. At 100 ants × 20 jobs per run,
